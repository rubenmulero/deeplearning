This is a basic tutorial of how to use Keras to create a convolutional neural network.


# Here are are using the Theano backend. In general we can configure this by modifying the ~.keras/keras.json

import numpy as np
# Creating a random seed for reprodicibility
np.random.seed(123)
# Import Keras and it's layers
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Activation, Flatten
# Import the Convolutional Neuronal Networks
from keras.layers import Convolution2D, MaxPooling2D
# Import some additional utils
from keras.utils import np_utils
# Loading Mnist dataset from KERAS
from keras.datasets import mnist

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Look the shape of the dataset
print(X_train.shape)        # 60000 samples of 28x28

# We are going to plot this examples using matplotlib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

plt.imshow(X_train[0])
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('plot of the first training set')
# plt.show()

# We need to declare the depth of the image in Theano library. In general an image contains a RGB channel
# that is a depth of = 3. but in other scenarios we have more!. In thi case mnist only contains 1 channel so
# we need to define a depth = 1

# We are going to transform our dataset to ahve the following shape --> (n, depth, width, height)

X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 1, 28, 28)
X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], 1, 28, 28)
# We are going to print again its dimensions to confirm
print(X_train.shape)

# OK, so now we are going to finish to preprocess this data giving it a float32 value and making a normalization
# to put in in range of [0,1]

X_train = X_train.astype('float32')
X_test = X_test.astype('float32')
X_train /= 255
X_test /= 255

########## label data
# Lets have a look on or label data
print(y_train.shape)
# We see that this can be problematic because we need to have 10 different clases and this shape doesn't represent
# that condition. We are going to have a look inside the the first 10 training samples:
print(y_train[:10])
# So the problem is that we need to convert the 1-dimensional class to 10-dimensional class matrices
Y_train = np_utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
Y_test = np_utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)
# now we can see that our shape its correct. We have 60000 samples with 10 possible clasifications (from 0 to 9)
print(Y_train.shape)

########### Model architecture
# After preparing the data, we are going to configure our CNN architecture.
#
model = Sequential()
# Defining the input layer
model.add(Convolution2D(32, 3, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,28,28)))
# The input shape is the information of each image -> 1 depth (black o white), 28 width and 28 height
# The third parameter represent -> the number of convolution filters, the number of rows in each convolution the number
# of columns in each convolution.
# We are going to confirm this model printing its shape
print(model.output_shape)
