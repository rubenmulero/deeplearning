Sample code to play with Deep Neuronal Networks
===============================================

This is a sample code based on TensorFlow's examples from Google. In adition, there are
other examples based on Keras.

The aim of this repository is to learn the concepts of Deep Learning and play with basic datasets.
There are multiple comments both in English and Spanish explaining each step.

Feel free to read the code, but all examples are available over the web.
